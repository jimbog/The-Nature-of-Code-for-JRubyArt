Building the nn Library
===================

You need jruby to run the included JRakefile, you also need the rake-compiler gem.

This is the way jruby-extensions get built for eg ruby-processing!!

But you can start process with mri ruby, so cd this directory and rake to compile and run.

Or rake clean to remove library jar (useful if you want to re-compile) and its build.
